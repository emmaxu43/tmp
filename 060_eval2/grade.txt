Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1  story-step1.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Your file did not match the expected output
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story.txt
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

Trying to parse story.txt				      <
Once upon a time, there was a _animal_ who lived in a very _a <
_place_. 						      <
Once upon a time, there was a cat who lived in a very cat	Once upon a time, there was a cat who lived in a very cat
cat. 								cat. 
							      (
Your file did not match the expected output


Step 2
Checking that story-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1  story-step1.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step2.c
gcc -o story-step2 story-step2.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step2 exists (good)
Now running YOUR tests for step 2

2.1: Current test is story-step2 words.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind reported errors or memory leaks:

Step 3
Checking that story-step3 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1  story-step1.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step3.c
gcc -o story-step3 story-step3.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step3.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step3 exists (good)
Now running YOUR tests for step 3

3.1: Current test is story-step3 words.txt story2.txt
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

Trying to parse story2.txt				      <

_adjective_ _place_. One day, it left its _2_ _2_ and met a _ <

Step 4
Checking that story-step4 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1  story-step1.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step4.c
The code did not compile!
