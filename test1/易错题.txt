Which of the following statements is true about an enumerated type in C?

a A variable of enum type can be assigned a new value.
b An enumerated type is most useful when you have a type of data with many
numerical values.
c An enumerated type allows you to bundle multiple variables into a single entity.
d Though enumerated types have integer values, they cannot be used in conditional
statements.

选a
a) A variable of enum type can be assigned a new value.

True. Enumerated types allow you to assign specific named values to variables. You can change the value of an enum variable by assigning a different valid enum constant.
b) An enumerated type is most useful when you have a type of data with many numerical values.

False. Enumerated types are useful when you want to assign meaningful names to integral constants, not necessarily when you have many numerical values.
c) An enumerated type allows you to bundle multiple variables into a single entity.

False. Enumerated types define a set of named constants, but they don’t bundle multiple variables.
d) Though enumerated types have integer values, they cannot be used in conditional statements.

False. Enumerated types are often used in conditional statements (such as if, switch, etc.) to compare the value of an enum variable with specific named constants.

enum默认是整数，每个成员对应一个整数值。
