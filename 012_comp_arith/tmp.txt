4. 陷阱题哇
int (5/3) = 1
1+2.4 = 3.4

6. 
hexa -> binary
0xFFFFFFFF = 1111 repeated for 8 times
it is a negative value
invert it 0000 repeated for 8 times
+1 -> 0000 repeated for 7 times+0001

convert this binary to decimal
it is 1
so it is -1

result = 5 -1 =4

7. same procedure
0111 + 1111 repeated for 7 times
it is a positive value
invert it -> 1000+0000 repeated for 7 times

this binary to decimal is 2^31 - 1 =2147483647

wait! here is the trap! add 5 will overflow the int data type.

since it is converted from hex, the most significant point determins negative/positive. i think it is signed int.
so the restart will begin wi -2**31
result = -2**31+4 = -2147483644
